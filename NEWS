CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.1
-------------------------

FEATURES
     o  Added examples for normr-methods, BamCountConfig-class & NormRFit-class
     o  Moved all documentation to one manpage (normr.Rd)
     o  Vignette: knitr-based vignette for normr finished
     o  exportR(): Export NormRFit objects to bed, bedGraph and bigWig
     o  plot(): Produce a small diagnostic plot for NormRFit objects
     o  diffR(): Intersection of results for switched labels increases
        specificity

BUGFIXES
     o  Removed deploy.log
     o  Fixed build errors and warnings
     o  Fixed failing test


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.0
-------------------------
o Initial Bioconductor Submission

FEATURES

     o  huge performance speedup by data compression to unique tupels only
     o  Kahan summation for log posterior summation to reduce numerical error
     o  Standardized enrichment computation in C++. This enrichment can be well
        compared between various ChIP-seq experiments
     o  exportR() function provides methods to export results of fits as a
        region bed file or bigWig track of standardized enrichment
